description: "My study plan for 2024 is clear and concrete. My goals include reaching N2 level in Japanese, completing both SICP and TAPL, delving deep into operating systems with the aim of building a fully functional POSIX kernel, and updating my blog’s theme. All of these targets are both challenging and motivating, offering a clear path for personal growth and skill development."
