  - title: "A Sleepless Night at Pudong Airport"
    descriptions:
      - "On Friday evening, right after work, I took the high-speed train to Shanghai Pudong Airport. The flight was booked for 6 a.m. Saturday. It was my first time catching such an early flight, and with no experience, I booked a hotel far from the airport. After some thought, I decided it was better to just tough it out and spend the night at the airport."
      - "Had I known in advance how tough it would be to spend the night at Pudong Airport, I would have preferred a few hours of rest at a hotel rather than sitting on a hard bench until dawn."
      - "To 'fall asleep quickly,' I even brought along two bottles of alcohol. In the end, they only made me more drowsy and the night even harder to endure."

The temple actually venerates Yakushi Buddha but is famous for selling cat amulets. Someone once spotted a tabby cat in the temple. Unfortunately, we didnâ€™t encounter any cats, though we heard meowing behind the Buddha statue. I bought a cat-themed planner strap, hoping to find a planner style I like someday."

      - "So we decided to take a less touristy route: climb to the actual summit of Mount Wakakusa to overlook the whole city of Nara."
